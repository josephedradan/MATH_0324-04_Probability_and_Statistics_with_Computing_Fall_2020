# MATH 0324-04 Probability and Statistics with Computing Fall 2020
Doing Math 324 Probability and Statistics using R and Python

### Notes
- Homework, TODO, and Forum Post solutions are in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **The code looks better if you use Jupyter than the github viewer.**
- Math 324 Homework is WebAssign.
- Python solutions primarily use numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
- R solutions use the base R library.
- I had to create custom algorithms to solve some homework problems in one go. Some of those algorithms were helpful during the exams.
- Homework solutions are in R or Python or Both.
- Past Chapter 3 I realized that doing the homework in Python and R was more time consuming than just writing it down on paper so some answers are incomplete or not done at all. Basically, if the homework took 6 hours to do then writing it in Python and R would take 12 hours+. 
- Some solutions involved me using MS paint to make the visual representation... 

### Questions and Answers
#### *Was it required to do the homework in Python or R?*
No, I did it because I though it would be cool and fun to do the homework in Python and R. Basically, I would automate my homework.
#### *Did that work?*
No, I realized I wasted to much time learning Python and R just so I could solve 1 problem.
#### *Will I convert my homework from paper to code eventaully?*
Yeah maybe...
#### Are the answers correct?
Yeah, also some questions have my answer along with the WebAssign answer.
